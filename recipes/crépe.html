<p>This easy French crêpe recipe makes thin, soft pancakes that can be filled with sweet or savory ingredients. Made with flour, eggs, milk, and a bit of oil or butter, the batter is simple and quick to prepare. Once cooked in a hot pan, the crêpes turn golden and flexible—perfect for rolling or folding with your favorite fillings like Nutella, fruit, or cheese.</p>
<h1>Ingredients (for about 10 crêpes):</h1>
<li>1cup (125g) all-purpose flour</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1 1/4 cups (300ml) milk</li>
<li>1 tbsp vegetable oil or melted butter</li>
<li>1 tbsp sugar (optional – for sweet crêpes)</li>
<li>1 pinch of salt</li>
<li>Butter or oil for the pan</li>
<h1>Instructions:</h1>
<h2>1.Make the batter:</h2>
<li>In a large bowl, whisk the flour and the eggs together.</li>
<li>Gradually add the milk while whisking to avoid lumps.</li>
<li>Add the oil (or melted butter), salt, and sugar if using. Mix until smooth.</li>
<li>Let the batter rest for at least 30 minutes (optional but recommended for better texture).</li>
<h2>2.Cook the crêpes:</h2>
<li>Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and lightly grease it with butter or oil.</li>
<li>Pour a small amount of batter (about 1/4 cup) into the pan and swirl it around to spread evenly.</li>
<li>Cook for about 1–2 minutes until the edges start to brown, then flip and cook for another 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
<li>Repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
<h2>3.Serve:</h2>
<li>Serve warm with your favorite fillings: sugar, jam, Nutella, fruits, whipped cream, or savory options like ham and cheese.</li>
